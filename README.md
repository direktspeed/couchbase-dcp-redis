Redis Server Implementation Using Couchbase and the DCP Protocol offers a Redis API for Couchbase and Couchbase EE


# Why?
I am not sure but this idea is there because i think it can be use full to process the dcp protocol with nodejs. 
and i think it would be maybe nice to have that with the java dcp client and the claudb implementation this would be maintainable.

maybe it is better to expose it as grpc or websocket implementation i am not sure
